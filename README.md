# Pong
Making pong from scratch in pygame. I've been learning pygame for like a week, so im trying to recreate pong!

I recreated all the mechanics of pong. Now it can play an infinite game of pong. I did this all within a span of a day, so I'm pretty proud of myself buahha!
I added a  fullscreen mode, it resets the game unfortunatley.
Next I will add a main menu and a game over at like 10 points
